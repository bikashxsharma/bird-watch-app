# birdWatch
 A responsive web application where users can add information about birds. 
##### Check the live demo from this link: https://birdwatch-app.netlify.comb

**Summary**

I did this project as a part of the coding exercise. The instruction was as follow:
##### Main view should include a dynamic list of observations
-- Observations should be ordered by timestamp
- Observation should display name of species, rarity, an excerpt of notes, and date and time
##### Main view should include a button for adding new observation
-- Clicking the button should navigate the user to observation form view
##### In observation form view user should be able to add a new observation
- User should be able to input the name of the species and notes
- User should be able to select rarity from a predefined list (common, rare, extremely rare)
- User should be able to save the observation
- The timestamp should be created when the observation is saved
- Users should be able to cancel the new entry. Any data entered by the user will be discarded and the
-observation will not be saved.
##### All observations should be saved locally on the device
- Saved observations should be persisted when the application is closed
